        heading="Hoi An,Vietnam"
        text="Hoi An is a place where the bold march of progress peters into a leisurely amble. In this one-time trading port, the Thu Bon River meanders past crumbling shop houses and weathered pagodas, while sampans come and go from the old ferry quay. Outside the Old Town, two-lane roads slice through waving rice fields and emerge at a frothy coastline. Stay a couple of days, and Hoi An's easygoing beauty and lantern-lit nights may leave you hopelessly beguiled."

        heading="Seoul,South Korea"
        text="From modern skyscrapers and neon lights to Buddhist temples, palaces and pagodas, Seoul is a fascinating mix of old and new. Take it all in from the N Seoul Tower, built atop a peak in Namsan Park. The teahouses and shops of Insadong give you a taste of Korean flavour, which you can further experience with a visit to the grounds and museums of Gyeongbokgung."
